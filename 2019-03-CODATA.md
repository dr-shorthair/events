Ernie Boyko - what are expectations from National Committees? What do they get for their dues?

Role of national committees: 
- what can they do? - give them a role, make them relevant - each national committee needs a mission that is connected to CODATA mission
    - e.g. Canada - coordinate training in data-intensive science: data professionals, data stewards - use train-the-trainers approach (this topic was not already being done by another organization)
    - e.g. Australia - (i) bridge edu (research community) and gov (PFRAs)? incentives, culture, project-lifecycle (E2SIP/NEEFF) (ii) host some key vocabularies? - something not already being done by ARDC, CSIRO, ...

***Accredit** organizations - 
- unions 
- standards bodies

**Certify** services & individuals - 
- repositories
- journals
- engineers

**Endorse** technologies
- schemas
- vocabularies
- APIs
- standards

There is no standard vocabulary/ontology for 'disasters' (Sendai)
