# CODATA General Assembly
## Day 1 - 2018-11-09
### Executive Director's report

3 areas of activity
1. Data Policy
2. Data Science
3. Capacity building and education

#### Data Science
**Data Integration Initiative** is part of Data Science focus.

**Data Science Journal** - citations per article improving rapidly since 2012. Now indexed. (_Must register as reviewer_)

Discussion on open-review process (currently not). Ubiquity Press was selected because of APC policy - 10% no APC + APC waiver fund.

- can send info design papers there, e.g. Prov-real? Sample definition?

#### Capacity building
**Data schools**

#### Secretariat

CODATA only has 2.5 FTE which includes data schools

Membership has not grown. Increased activities build profile and product, but not yet membership. But secretariat is over-stretched, need more FTE ...

2 kinds of members pay dues
- **Science Unions**
- **National members** - should run a "National Committee"

National committee should be 'representative of data community', often hosted in national academy.
- engage - point of contact with CODATA and other members
- influence - CODATA strategy
- coordinate - keep national strategy aligned with international best practice
- collaborate - task groups etc,
- partner - with other national committees

### CODATA success stories
- Fundamental constants (Planck's constant)
- Data citation (now DataCite)
- TDWG (now primarily GBIF)
- FAIR (now branded as Force11)

Not promoted enough.

### CODATA Constitution
Changes to:
- 2-year cycle for general assembly
- allow for electronic meetings
- additional member types
  - commercial, institutional (while not compromising historical continuity and integrity of national and unions)
  - individual members, emeritus office-holders
- ICSU (+ ISSC) &rarr; ISC

### CODATA strategy
#### Geoffrey Boulton
Web is a 'general purpose technology'

Recent priorities of CODATA
- open data/open science
- Frontiers of data sciences
- capacity building

ISC is formal channel for science disciplines into the UN

Transition from challenges for science &rarr; challenges for society created by the digital revolution

#### Tony Hey
Make large science datasets available for ML benchmarking.

Data science roles
- Data engineer
- Data analyst
- Data steward

Other important initiatives
- Data analytics, ML/AI
- African open science platforms
- Links to community research projects, case studies and success stories

Global projects that have made a difference
- DataONE - coordinating nodes that keep metadata, federated search
- SKA - South African dev opportunity
- Earth system grid federation
- Elixir - semantics

Strategy 2019-2024
- increase CODATA Membership
- increase focus on ML/AI - incl. case studies for advocacy
- expand scope of African Open Science Platform

#### Barend Mons
New Infrastructure for Open Science

European Open Science Cloud = internet of FAIR data / internet for social machines
_Machine is the end user_

Patterns in revolutionary infrastructures and data

vision &rarr; creolization &rarr; attraction &rarr; convergence &rarr; exploitation

- Minimal standards only
- voluntary participation
- critical mass
- rough consensus & running code

Complementary roles (ternary diagram)
- CODATA - endorse best practices (standards org)
- RDA - consensus building - design
- GO-FAIR - testing and Implementation
